    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It restricts access to some of an object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they possess. It allows the programmer to focus on the relevant aspects of an object while ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base class or parent class). It promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of specialized classes based on more general ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. It enables flexibility in code design by allowing objects of different classes to be used interchangeably when they share a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these four pillars provide a solid foundation for designing and implementing object-oriented systems, promoting modularity, maintainability, and extensibility in software development.\n",
