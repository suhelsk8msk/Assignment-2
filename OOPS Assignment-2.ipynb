    "Ans - Abstraction and encapsulation are two important principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but they refer to different concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:  Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It involves the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the relevant features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: It focuses on providing a high-level view of an object, emphasizing what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In the context of a car, abstraction involves representing a car as an object with essential features such as accelerating, braking, and honking, without exposing the intricate details of the engine, transmission, or other internal mechanisms. Users interact with the abstracted representation (e.g., accelerate(), brake()) without needing to understand the underlying complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:  Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It involves restricting access to some of an object's components and only exposing what is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: It aims to achieve information hiding, protecting the internal state of an object and controlling access to its data and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Continuing with the car analogy, encapsulation involves bundling the attributes (e.g., make, model, speed) and methods (e.g., accelerate(), brake()) into a Car class. The internal details of how speed is updated or how the car's make and model are stored are hidden from the external world. Users interact with the car through its public interface."
